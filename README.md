## *Description ðŸ“ƒ*
Box Merge is an interactive game where players control a colored box to merge with matching-colored boxes, increasing in size and score while avoiding different-colored boxes that cause shrinking and score loss. 

## *Functionalities ðŸŽ®*

1. Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. Control your colored box to merge with matching-colored boxes, increasing in size and score.
3. Avoid different-colored boxes that cause your box to shrink and decrease your score.
4. Monitor your score as you play.
5. When your score reaches 100 points, you win the game, displaying a winning message and a button to restart the game.
6. If your box's size becomes too small (number <= 0), you lose the game, displaying a losing message and a button to restart the game.

1. Controls: Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move your colored box.
2. Scoring: Each merge with a matching-colored box increases your score by 10 points. Each collision with a different-colored box decreases your score by 5 points.
3. Difficulty: As you merge with matching-colored boxes, the game gets harder as you need to manage a larger box while avoiding shrinkage.
4. Winning Condition: Reach a score of 100 points to win the game.
5. Losing Condition: If your box's size becomes too small (number <= 0), you lose the game.
6. Game Over: When you win or lose, a message is displayed with an option to restart the game.
